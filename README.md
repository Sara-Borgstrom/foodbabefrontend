# Final Project 
Backend - endpoints for new user, sign in and authorization and new blogpost. Conected to cloudinary that handles images.

Frontend - Home page presenting the different foodbabe citys. About page presenting the foodbabes. Blog page where they can add image, description and typ of restaurant. 

## Problem
Want to make an admin page, where only the admins can make sign in and sign up to update blogposts. At the moment it's not solved in a way that I like. 

Issues with losing connection on blog page when trying to upload.
